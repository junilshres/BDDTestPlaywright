# Simple BDD TypeScript Example

This is a simple repository to practice BDD in TypeScript using Cucumber.js.
Now includes Playwright e2e tests and a sample calculator UI.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run BDD tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Run Playwright e2e tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. Open `calculator.html` in your browser to test manually.

## File Structure

- `features/addition.feature` — Gherkin feature definition.
- `src/calculator.ts` — Calculator logic.
- `steps/addition.steps.ts` — Step definitions.
- `e2e/calculator.spec.ts` — Playwright browser test.
- `calculator.html` — Simple UI for calculator.

You can expand UI and add more Playwright tests for practice!
